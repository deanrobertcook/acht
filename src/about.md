My name is Dean.\
I’m a software developer, a mover, a thinker, und auch stolzer Berliner.

I’m curently concerned with our growing dependency on technology, which has become something of a modern religion, promising omnipotence, immortality and deliverence. 

And yet, the wheels are falling off this big, global wagon: Depression, self-harm and inequality are on the rise in our own backyards. We are divided politically and struggle to reach consensus on the simplest of matters. Conspiratorial thinking floods our over-connected digital community, clearing the way for a virus that has the physical world on its knees. Our technology is so complex that even those building it don’t understand what they’re doing.

We would do well to recognise our cognitive limits as we try to expand our reach across the entire planet (and beyond). With a mindful, values-based application of technology, tailored to our local needs - seen as a tool, not as God - we might be able to disconnect from the Internet and reconnect with each other.

How this looks concretely, I don’t know. But currently I imagine a technologically independent Hauptstadtregion with it’s own independent IT infrastructure making it’s own decisions; a shining example of resistence against the greedy FAANG.
