Mein Name ist Dean, urspr√ºnglich aus Australien, aber nach sieben Jahren in Berlin kann ich auch langsam sagen, dass ich stolzer Berliner bin.

I am a software developer (currently [on the hunt](hire-me.html) for a new job!), but that's not how I primarily define myself. In fact, I'm not sure exactly how to define myself. That's mostly what this blog is about: [figuring that out](finding-my-vocation.html) and in doing so, practice [writing](why-write.md). It's also a good chance to practice some web development. I built it entirely by scratch, but for more information on that please see the [GitHub repo README](https://github.com/deanrobertcook/acht).

The name for the blog is the German word for eight. One of my dearest friends once explained to me why she see's the octopus as my spirit animal, and I've held onto that ever since. Deswegen: Acht. It also means *attention*, like in the word *Achtsamkeit* (Engl: *mindfulness*).

Please don't hesitate to reach out for any reason - whether it's to work together or to criticise any of my ideas.
