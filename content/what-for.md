What is the point of technological progress? If I were to ask a younger version of myself, we might have eventually uncovered my underlying hope for a fully automated, post-scarcity utopia in which human beings no longer die of age or sickness and spend their time travelling the galaxy in search for meaning as to our existence. By no means a unique stance on the modern world.

However, there are two problems I want to address here this philosophy of hoping to improve the future. The first is hope itself. The second is chaos. 
## The problem, is hope.
Hope is the state of being in which we are unsatisfied, frustrated or scared of our current predicament. We begin to hope for a change of state, and we become fixated on what that future state might be. Wherever there is hope, it can be telling to ask: what fear is driving it? 

As to the *hope* for a tech-utopia, what are we afraid of in our modern, industrial society? Why are we constantly pushing for "progress" and tripping over our own heels for the next technological innovation? The answer to me is very clear: more than ever we're afraid of death. The march of our technological progress seems to be driven by the desire to secure our place in this universe: to conquer, once and for all, our own mortality while insuring ourselves against the galaxy's erruptive, violent tendencies. 

Our utopia isn't here yet, and based on many unfortunate limitations of our psychology and of physics itself, probably never will arrive. But the one thing we do have for sure right now is our hope. It drives our hunger for more and for faster. It drives our collective seeking for efficiency, growth and security: *if only we can crack nuclear fusion, or self-driving cars, then we'll save millions of lives and have all the freedom to do whatever we want!* 

Ironically, however, with every new achievement we secure for ourselves we take one step further away from death, and so we lose our familiarity to and acceptance of our own mortality. This in turn, makes us more afraid of the darkness surrounding our existence and serves only to strengthen our hope for the future. 

## The fog of chaos.
History does not progress in cycles, nor does it progress linearly, exponentially or in any other simple shape you can think of. Our destiny is funamentally [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory).

Chaos is an interesting beast. Things may appear like progress, or appear to be repeating themselves, but as soon as we begin to think we've secured some degree of success, chaos seeps in unseen all around us. Chaos is the force that makes all prediction of the future utterly futile. That which was once good becomes an unholy evil on humanity, and the terrifying experiences we live through become blessings in disguise. 

Chaos is at play when wartime innovation leads to the most prosperous century in human history, which in turn leads to a new geological era defined by mass extinction. Chaos is the reason that a bat in Wuhan can trigger a global economic crisis (and the reason it wasn't a butterfly, as we've long been predicting), and why it's impossible to say, just what this crisis will bring.  

Ultimately, chaos is what makes hope so dangerous. The march of history can, for a time, seem to be predictable. We feel as though we've closed off our safe space or reached the "End of History". We feel as though it's just a matter of time until we unlock general artifical intelligence and master the solar system. With our blinders firmly affixed, we march ever more confident into the future, sure that death can no longer touch us. 

But it's in this state that we are most vulnerable to whatever surprises the future might bring us. 

## Playfully observe
Neither hope or chaos are bad things. They're entirely neutral. Both are in fact necessary for existence itself. Chaos generates the information necessary for complexity to give rise to life, just as any self-replicating entity also has needs to satisfy which it will experience as some form of hope as it goes about satisfying them.

But with this shallow dive into our psyches and the complexity of the universe itself I hope (!) to establish the basis for a different attitude towards technology. Some combination of playfulness and observation. Let's call it playful observation.

Since we cannot do without hope, our best strategy is to be aware of it. We need hope, but we don't need any specific hope. We can observe our fears, where they are driving us and constantly redefine our hopes as the universe continues to take us for a ride. As we reassess our hopes in the face of constant change, we need to be aware that that which now feels like defeat might soon turn into victory, and vice versa. 

Since we must accept that with every unavoidable step we take forward on the path to satisfying our hopes, we send out ripples of change that chaotically mingle with our environment and eventually come back to us in unexpected ways. 

By maintaining a playful attitude with the universe, we can start to see the "bad" as just another part of the chaotic dance all around us. After all, our fear of death is based on another prediction about what happens to our subjective senses of self when we die that we have no way of confirming. 

With playfulness in hand, it becomes then easier to hold onto our hopes less tightly. We become more agile in dropping and redefining them based on how we actually see the world. This is then where it becomes important to develop our powers of observation. Seeing the world more clearly as it is, and that we only ever have limited information when trying to do so, helps us more cleverly craft our hopes to adeptly navigate whatever change comes our way. 

## Technology and society
So what does all this have to do with technology. 

Well, we want to develop technologies that primarily help us with this grand sense of playfulness and improve our powers of observation. In essence, anything that helps us experiment more while having a smaller impact (ultimately, all observation is still interaction, even looking through a telescope).

And technologies that we should avoid? Things that distract us and make us serious.
