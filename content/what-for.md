Despite my growing skepticism of modern tech, I'm not a Luddite. We need our technology, we need to keep advancing it. It's what we choose to do with technology that concerns me. 

## What is progress?
- I grew up with a very linear, global sense of progress. Things were bad everywhere, and are now better everywhere. One day, AI and science will save us all.
- For sure, there are many reasons to believe the world is becoming a [better and better place](https://www.gapminder.org/). However, these statistics are global averages. The real topology looks much more complicated (e.g., suicide is declining globally, but increasing for men in the U.S.).
- History itself is also far from linear. We only have records for the last 5-10,000 years. Read closely into any period and we see things are chaotic. There are twists and turns as things are discovered and forgotten again; gains accrue only to grow stagnant and brittle and then explosively shatter off through disruption and revolution.
- Progress is also thought of as a single dimension - often in terms of efficieny of use of a given resource. Technology actually pushes us into more dimensions as the breadth of human creativity is unlocked. This is, however, not a default force for good. Technology is an agent of change. The very idea of progress is misleading.

## Enhancement and dependence
- Some technologies extend our intrinsic capabilities. Most of these have been analogue: e.g. the abacus may have actually given itss users a new mental model to help them with arithmetic even when the abacus was taken away! A digital calculator has the opposite effect.
- Our technology, while impressive, is a long way away from fulfilling all of our needs. We may be able to automate things, but we [lose many important qualities](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mistakenly-seeking-solitude/id1474245040?i=1000452731206) in doing so. We should be careful when deciding what to automate.
- Increases in efficiency also lead to rebound effects, where we then negate the gains in efficiency by performing the deleterious action more frequently. 
- As I see it, we have three key goals: to live in harmony with our environment, with each other, and with ourselves. Chasing efficiency, leading to overconsumption, automating out human interaction, and atrophying our abilities are three key ways in which technology is harming us.
