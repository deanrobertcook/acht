- The distinction between intelligent understanding and systematic communication
- The goal is to achieve understanding. Understanding does not happen in the communication itself. Understanding requires context. It is the in-situ awareness 

Something I'm seeing a lot of recently is the tendency to want to capture everything in spreadsheets, checklists, automated scripts and very strict build pipelines. 

## Language, computation and categories

These things all have in common that they are attempting to disect and categorise the real world into processable, computable, understandable chunks. This is fundamentally how all communication works: our brains have the capacity to (at least partially) understand the complexity of all the simultaneous happenings going on around us. Our brains are so good at this because they too are incredibly parallel in nature. This understanding then eventually gets broken down into a linear, serial list of words or, in the modern context, a spreadsheet with values or computer program written as a serial set of instructions. In other words, we break the continous, interconnected world into a set of boxes with labels. We share this puny set of categories with another person via some medium, and from there they piece back together - with the help of the shared context between the two human beings, and perhaps a computer - what the speaker originally intended to show them, at which point their attention is drawn to the object at hand, and they then hopefully understand what is important about it. In this sense, language and computation have a pointing function, similar to how you might point at an object in the distance with your finger to show somebody there is something important *over there*. 

Our words and our computations are becoming increasingly complex and powerful. There is no doubt that a modern computer (nothing but a series of ones and zeros, i.e. a series of words), can achieve a lot. But even a computer has one purpose - to point other human beings (or ourselves in the future) to something interesting *in the real world*. In other words: the point of computation is not computation, just as the point of language is not language. A computation that in no way ever affects a human being is utterly pointless, just as a word that has no real meaning is quickly forgotten. Even when we play with language or use computers for fun, that is computation translating into human experience. 

To forget this is to be like a dog who looks at your finger when you point at something in the distance. To not understand this fact is to confuse the map for the terrain. 

As our computations and with it our ability to express detail increase in power, it can become easy to get lost within our categories, and forget that we only care about the reality they point to. Hell, most white-collar professions in the last century have all been about supporting and improving upon our systems of categorisation. It's an easy trap to fall for to think that you can automate everything, classify anything, solve all problems with an app or change everyone's opinion if you could just find the right words (cough).

Finding the right words though, is ultimately impossible. In order to capture the full complexity of what's going on, you would need a computer that can work to infinite precision, or an infinite number of distinct words. That is, you would need a computer (or part of the brain dedicated to speach) that's bigger than the universe. 

## Intelligence
Intelligence, the thing that does the understanding behind language and computation, seems to be a feature of complex, highly interconnected and highly parallel networks. A flood of input, a ton of processing, lot's of training and with some luck, you get an intelligent output. Intelligence allows us to look beyond the limits of our categories; to break the rules when they no longer make sense and to even gain insight into something that can't yet be put into words (e.g. the indian mathematician). 

Any system that has these features is intelligent, whether it is your own brain, or a team full of experts working together to solve a problem. Even the whole universe can be considered intelligent, as it constantly breaks its own patterns and gives rise to new ones that would defy any linear system of rules.

Intelligence is what we need more of, not rules or categories. We have enough of those 



## What about play with language and computers?

Something I see a lot of in office environments, especially technical ones where people write a lot of code, is the tendency to want to capture everything in spreadsheets, checklists and automated scripts. What do spreadsheets, checklists, documentation, scripts, computer programs and even human languages have in common? They are systems of thought designed to disect and categorise the real world into processable, computable, understandable chunks. They are by definition effable; simpler than the continuous, messy and *ineffable* world upon which they are applied. They decontextualise that which they represent, separating objects from the graph of all interconnected processes in the universe, giving us mortals a chance to reason about them as "things" which we might use to our advantage. Through language and computation we prevent catastrophe, speed up repetative processes and make it possible to share understanding. 

Most of the tough problems in our lives though, the ones actually worth solving, defy control and categorisation. The real world is fundamentally chaotic and unpredictable. 



These are the fundamentally human problems. Trust, safety, inspiration, creativity and fullfilment have never been capture in a spreadsheet, nor will they ever be. 



The problem of human communication within the workplace is a fundamentally messy and chaotic one that defies all attempts to control and categorise it. A spreadsheet might help you remember someones phone number, age and what degree they have, but it will not tell you that Jane is slightly annoyed with John this week because he forgot to tell her before he published the latest version of his code and now she has unexpected errors she knows nothing about. Documentation can help you discover an API but cannot tell you that Jack is bored at work and already talking to recruiters from Fooglazon about his next career step. All of these very human concerns are the bedrock for the flow of technical information that ultimately spells success or failure for the company: If I don't feel comfortable around you as a person then that's only one extra barrier to me working cooperatively with you. 

There is only one system I am aware of that can handle this messiness, and that's expert, *human* intelligence. As a manager, as a leader, you need to get out from behind the spreadsheets and checklists and be communicating with those you are responsible for. You need to be understanding and resolving people's personal problems; clearing the way so that your technical experts can do their technical jobs. This poses a problem though, as interacting with other human beings is hard and scales poorly. You have to spend quality 1-to-1 time with each person, understanding who they are and what's important to them.

This is particularly problematic for the fate of the post-pandemic work environment. As more and more companies are moving to a remote-hybrid model that sees people coming into the office less frequently, we will see a degredation in both the quality and the bandwidth of person-to-person communication. This is why all-remote companies that have been doing it for a long time staff people who's sole responsibility is to facilitate the communication that gets lost online. If you're going for a hybrid model and still have an office space, then you need to use it wisely and ensure those people that work together interact frequently together. 

Understanding your domain and your own capability as a company is dependant on the flow of information between you and your colleagues. In order to keep that flow healthy, as a leader, you have to be willing to get your hands dirty and eschew yesterdays categories as the ever-changing terrain under our feet makes them useless.
