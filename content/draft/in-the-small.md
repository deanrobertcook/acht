- Our entire world is fractal in nature.
- The modern Geist seems to be enthralled with exploring and expanding. Pushing into new terrain is often the easiest way to find new resources, make more space and gain fame fast. 
- However, as the world becomes more crowded and new terrain scarcer, we'd best start exploring what we already have. 
- I recently heard a great term for this, optimising as n -> 0, a.k.a. optimising in the small. 
- The alternative is at heart, expansionism, which needless to say, brings with it much suffering.

## Technology
- What technology has the promise of reducing road deaths and emissions due to passenger transport (which make up the largest overall portion of emissions due to [transport](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#transport-16-2))? Self-driving cars? Electric cars? Hyperloops? Turns out, it's [the humble bus](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/missing-the-bus/)
- What about finding ways to keep our water cleaner and make sure everyone has enough? How about by giving our [toilet systems an overhaul](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pipe-dreams/)?
- What about something smaller and more personal, like not receiving any more updates for your mobile phone that's still only 3-4 years old? Time for an upgrade? How about tapping into an ecosystem of enthusiasts who wring [every last bit out](https://fsfe.org/activities/upcyclingandroid/) of their phones?

- Often promised better futures by tech giants.
- Instead, focus on the tech we have and integrate it better.

## Travel
- Travel is often seen as an unalloyed good
- Tourism on the other hand, can have [serious negative impacts](https://awareimpact.com/negative-effects-of-tourism/)
- Again, the more expensive option seems to be the most popular. 
- No surprise: the autombile industry wants more driving, airlines and travel agencies want more flying. Tourism industry has convinced us (your favourite cocktail) on an exotic beach is a sign of status
- What company campaigns for getting on a train or bus and [exploring your local city](https://lbib.de/Berlin-Spaziergaenge-durch-alle-96-Ortsteile-103321)?
- Instead, exploring home leads to greater connectedness with those you come into contact with more often, and a greater awareness of where you might do good.

- How might we still get the benefits of travel? Perhaps with slower, more deliberate forms of travel
- Taking sabbaticals to travel for months at a time, learning about local languages and customs, taking trains and boats to appreciate the distance.
- Be careful with the temptation to move away from home - turns out the happiest people are those that live within 100km of they're parents

## Doing Good
- There's a lot of good being done by companies finding out which [charities are most effective](https://www.givewell.org/)
- The very existence of GiveWell begs the questions - how good are we at giving globally?
- But imagine if you had to help the people most in need in your city? Would you need much research to figure out who they are? 
- You're understanding of your local environment can be better leveraged than your weak understand of what really causes global poverty. 
- If we focused on helping those in our own back yards, and left Africa alone (which means [trading fairly](https://www.coffeecircle.com/de/e/direct-trade-prinzipien)), we might end up doing more good overall.

## New Article: Should we donate locally or globally?
- But what about [the argument](https://www.eleven.ngo/blog/giving-locally-vs-globally) that we have more evidence on how to help the global poor or that it's cheaper to help them? 
> However, itâ€™s not true that our understanding of more distant problems is generally worse and their solution more uncertain. Scientific charity evaluators such as GiveWell have gathered a lot of evidence about how best to reduce the suffering of people in developing countries. This evidence often comes from randomized controlled trials and is thus on a par with (or better than) the evidence about how to fix the problems of people in rich countries.
- But how much evidence do we have in rich countries? It's [harder to rally support](http://obdachlosinberlin.de/unterfinanziert/) for messy, complicated local problems like homelessness, crime, and mental illness. When the waste of donating innacurately is considered, how much more effective is donating to a developing country?
- Finally, imagine a city with astoundingly low internal problems? Might a city like that be in a better position to cohere on a solution to help the world's poorest? A quick search for "Top 10 Countries Contributing to Foreign Aid" shows: Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Canada and Finland - some of the happiest countries in the world (France, the UK, the US and Japan probably have other reasons they *should* be donating globally...).

We struggle at understanding complex global structures and are much better at understanding our own homes. While this doesn't mean that we should ignore global trends that might nullify our local efforts, the more we look down, pull back the curtains and examine what's around us and how we might more efficiently make use of what we already have - when we optimize in the small - the more our efforts might, when averaged over 8 billion people, start to make a really big difference.
