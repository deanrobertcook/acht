It's tempting to end the debate there: "just fix the incentives and boom! Mission accomplished". But which incentive structures do we pick for ourselves? Well, perhaps that can be answered with a few [well-conducted studies](https://www.gallup.com/home.aspx)? Just find out which structures offer the most utilitarian benefit and implement those, right? If it's obvious that more equal representation of women throughout our society brings us closer to say, [reaching our climate goals](https://bloombergcities.medium.com/5-women-mayors-to-watch-for-climate-leadership-3d3ea407afed), then that's a force for good we want to replicate elsewhere with similar incentive structures around the world.

Now, for the record, I do in fact think that's a fantastic strategy: follow those plans with the best evidence we have. But, in my opinion, it's only half the battle. I'm going to call it the top-down approach: look around the world for systems that provably work and design a incentive structures that [nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_%28book%29) us in the right direction. People with authority and knowledge are designing systems that reach down into and shape our lives. 

If this were a calculus problem, I see it as the part where we [find the integral](https://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers). But what are we putting back together here as we attempt to integrate the lifestyles of millions of people into one cohesive whole?

The answer here are our values. The intuitions that we build up over the course of our lives that tell us whether something is going well or going poorly; our gut feelings of what is right and wrong. To continue stretching this abstract analogy, our value systems allow us to measure the slope of our current trajectory through life, in this moment in time and space - within our individual contexts. They are the derivative. 

Before any large-scale incentive (re)design can take place, it takes individuals with nothing but a hunch to recognise that our trajectory isn't right. There will have been, at this point in time, no research conducted that tells these people *why* things aren't right. They will not be able to rationalise and justify the intuition yet. They will just *know* things aren't right.

Our values allow us to make these judgements. They are the axioms we hold for ourselves and have gathered - implicitly or explicitly - over the course of our lives that have allowed us to survive this far. As a society, we would do well to really listen to not only our own value judgements, but those of our fellow citizens. 

While I'm an optimist and believe that most people are mostly good most of the time, not all values are good. Some are empty, some destructive, some hateful. Some allow us to be easily exploited or cause us to be overly cautious in exploring the world. For this reason, it's important for us to reflect on and examine our values as closely as possible. 

One way I like to do this is to simply list them out and explore their limits. So, without further ado, here are the values I have steadily come to see as the positive ones guiding my life. I don't claim to live up them perfeclty all the time - perhaps I'll do another article exploring my more sinister, implicit values when I'm feeling braver - but for now, it's a start:
