# Trade offs
Trade-offs and compromises are inherent in every decision we make. Nothing is perfect and there are no silver bullets (except for those few rare cases where there really are silver bullets). Everything has some degree of error and it will be impossible to please everybody with every decision taken. 

That much is - or at least, should be - obvious to just about anybody. I really doubt that, push come to shove, anyone would believe that the thing they might have been vehemently arguing about one moment ago should be carried to an extreme. Too much of anything and it soon becomes obvious how it might go wrong.

While it's wise to keep this in mind when evaluating a situation or learning new facts and ideas, when it comes to leadership, there's a huge problem with falling back on these cliched generalities; namely, they can often be used as a means of deflecting criticism.

If when presented with an idea that you disagree with, and your response is to fall back to "yes, but every decision has tradeoffs", then you're being dishonest. It should be obvious to both you and your opposition that you're really debating exactly *which* trade-offs are better. Your stand point also has trade-offs, and not all trade-offs are made equal - that's why they're called trade-offs. From the point of view of your idea, it's a fight to the death to see which one wins, but abdicating to a higher level of moral equanimity is to shy away from the conflict and an opportunity to grow. 

The idea has to win by itself, on its own merit, not with the help of platitudes that are true everywhere and useful nowhere. Have courage and put your ideas on the line and be ready to face the consquences when they don't survive the fight.

# Radical honesty
A similar pattern can be seen in much more personal relationships. We all know it's better to be as honest as you can, to the point that some people experiment with never lying - not even the smallest, white lie. 

Again; however, defaulting back to a rule like this has its drawbacks. While honesty generally is a great policy, one must understand that timing is everything, and one has no choice but to filter events through their own lens, making the "truth" hard to really pin down. Just blurting out everything you think, feel and experience as the ultimate truth is an abdication of your responsibility in a relationship: your responsibility to empathise with the other, to ask yourself whether or not they're ready for your version of the truth, and your responsibility to help them carry the implications that the truth might bring along.

Sometimes, even in the most honest and open of relationships, holding back on the full truth for the right moment actually requires more empathy and understanding for your partner than just spilling the beans and forcing them to clean them up.

# Democracy
Back to the realm of leadership, and we have yet another example of where being a good person requires constant vigilance and an readiness to abandon fixed rules. 

When making decisions, it can be very tempting as a leader to cast votes. Use a democratic process to arrive at conclusions and you've harnessed the intelligence of the group! 

However, not all decisions, and especially none of the interesting ones - will have a clear majority backing. In these cases, what is often needed is a leader who can take risk and own anything that might go wrong. What's often more important than everyone being happy is movement in some direction. A leader who is switched on and intune will - with some luck - notice whether her decision is the right one and correct course if too late. 

A referendum though, is a great way for a leader's personal insecurity to create disorder within team. Once again, put ideas on the line and be ready to face the music if they don't work out.
