We naturally think in certainties in an attempt to save effort and actually cope with the huge number of decisions we have to make every day. If we were to challenge every assumption or wait until we were certain about every action, we would never make progress on even the simplest of tasks.

It makes sense, evolutionarily speaking, that we don't need to wait for the best possible solution when the goal is to simply survive<sup>1</sup>. Any answer will do. And yet we live in a complex world where the suboptimalities of our solutions, whether it be in how we treat our environment or each other, can have huge external consequences when summed over large enough populations; Ã  la tragedy of the commons. 

One incredibly effective way I find of challenging assumptions is to simply ask questions. Restating a belief as a question seems to invert the logic of the idea itself, and suddleny the assumptions bubble to the surface. Saying "X is Y" is one thing, but then asking "Why is X Y?" immediately begs another question: "Is X even Y?". Once clear on the assumptions, you can then go about finding a way to answer the question. 

This page is dedicated to the questions I find interesting enough to want to answer. These are the things I want to learn more about in the world, and hopefully the answers I find will lead to interesting essay ideas. This page can be thought of as a "What I'm currently thinking about" page. It will be messy and change constantly, but I see it as a vital part of this messy writing proceess.

## On values 
- What does it mean to value something?
- What are values even? From a neuroscience/computer science/philosophical perspective?
- How do values, principles and virtues differ from each other?
- Is it important to have values? Is it possible to even not have values? Do we implicitly always value something? 
- Is it important to be clear about your values? What happens if we're not clear on our values? 
- Which values are most important?
- What do some of the most important people or organisations in the world value? How would you find that out?
- Can having a poor value structure lead to anger, depression, addiction?
- What is a poor value structure?
- How are values shared between different people?

## On technology and globalisation
- Is technological progress a good thing? When is it not? What does technology take away from us as we embrace more of it in our lives?
- Do we need more technological progress? For what do we need and want technology?
- Are the tech giants making the world a worse or a better place?
- Are we too connected in the modern world? What can other networks in nature tell us about the health of the global economy?
- What problems need to be tackled globally, and which ones locally/regionally? Are we capable of global coordination?
- How might we regain control of technological progress, is it even possible?
