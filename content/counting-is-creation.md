title: On Counting and Creation

Today, I learnt something profound. As is often the case, I've been humbled by how much our ancienct ancestors were already hot on this trail two millenia ago. This little journey started with the question, why isn't the number one considered prime?

## The Monad
The answer itself is not entirely relevant to my insight (a link to the answer below), but as I was reading a bit about the history of this mathematical convention, I learnt something interesting. One wasn't even considered a number until about 500 years ago. 

The Pythagoreans believed that the first thing to have existed was something known as the "monad", or The *One;* the first thing from which all else emanated and even divinity itself. The monad, according to the Greeks, begat the dyad (which can be thought of as "otherness"), which then itself begat the numbers, then points, geometry, and so forth. 

## Start Counting
Weirdly enough, the number two is a lot easier to grasp than the number one. Once you have a thing, it's easy to just imagine another one of them or reuse your definition of "one" a second, third or fourth time. But what does it really mean to have one of something? What is the number one? 

At first this seems rather silly. Hold up a finger. There, you have one finger. But really, we're starting from many fingers. We only know what a finger is because we've seen countless examples before. If you start to dig at the definition though, it becomes fuzzy. Where would you say your finger starts? Just above the webbing connecting it to the next finger? Or does it include the lowest knuckle that would otherwise make up a fist? Conversely, where does the finger end? If you clip your nails, was the part that came off another finger? What about the bits of dead skin that slowly drop away and diffuse with the air around it, or the blood pumping in and out of your finger, bringing new nutrients in and cellular waste out? Is that all one finger?

Okay, let's try something simpler: draw a single, short, black line on a white piece of paper. There you have one line. But what is a line? A thin sheet of atoms that absorb more light than the atoms below it? If you were to look close enough, you'd soon lose track of the fact you're even looking at a line. It would look more like the coast of England as the ink has unevenly spread out into fine grains of the paper. Get even closer, and you'd eventually find that concepts like black and white don't make sense as your level of magnification approaches the wavelength of visible light. What is a line then? 

Applying the abstract concept of "one" into the real world, it seems, is rather tricky. I imagine this is why the Pythagoreans considered one to be so special.

## Creation
Reality itself never allows for separation into clean objects. In fact, objects don't exist. The universe is one big, interconnected, chaotic process, with everything influencing everything else spontanouesly and simultaneously. 

If you believe in free will, then the first thing that you can count depends entirely on you, the observer. It depends upon your needs, desires and point of view out into the universe. What you are doing is choosing what counts as one object: dividing up the ultimate, interconnected and messy universe into the first "thing". 

This process is incredibly useful to our survival. Ultimately, it's how all of our language and technology work. We define a thing, count it, describe it, and use it to go on and manipulate other things. 

Every time you count, even every time you name a thing - these are acts of pure creation. From the original emptiness, the primordial chaos you create something which goes on in a universe of its own. The implications of this are interesting. Pay attention to when you wake up in the morning as the confusion of the night's dreams pass and the objects of your everyday world slowly come to retake their shape and meaning to you. What are you counting as things - that is, what are you bringing into creation as you move about your life? Bring your attention to them and see if you can observe the life you give them. Do they make your universe a fun place to live, or do these things go on to cause pain and suffering? 

Do you even count yourself as a thing? 

What lies in the vast emptiness before a thing has been defined? Are you part of that emptiness? Is it a part of you?
