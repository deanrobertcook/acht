I always liked to divide my life into broad "areas" of focus. As I was younger, I used to have four. They were "Technology", "Fitness", "Language" and "Music". These areas guided where I placed my attention and served that purpose very well, as I would eventually become a software developer, could speak German, learnt how to play the Guitar and have kept quite fit over the years. Basically, I would value anything that fit into one of those areas more highly than anything else.

Eventually though, I started to realise the limits of these broad areas. For starters, I picked them when I was 18. There was a lot I was yet to learn about living a good life. In short, they left out some of the most important factors in determining happiness and were very self-oriented. In particular, I used to never set goals or intentions around other people, primarily because I felt I was less in control of others' behaviour. However, that discounts to heavily just how much one can influence their own relationships. 

So, over the last couple of years, I've been restructuring and reshaping these areas. Now I've settled on a set of concentric rings that I can return to whenever I'm unsure about what to focus on. The inner most rings follow a philosophy of "Apply your own oxygen mask first" - that is, to get my own house in order before trying to help the world. The outermost ones are newer and give me a little more meaning to aim for in life. So, without further ado, here are my areas; the things I value the most:

## Mind
Exploring and understanding one's internal world is really the ultimate project in life. Whatever the details of our circumstances, it's really our attitude to the external world and to ourselves that makes all the difference in just what our experience will be. 

The tools for doing so here vary greatly, the most useful being some form of mindfulness practice. As one then begins to observe the nature of their own mind, new ways of mediating the internal experience become possible.

Understanding the human condition is the next logical step. Where do our impulses, desires, needs and wants come from? If we're to design a successful life within our increasingly complex world, we need to know what's going to work and what runs against our very nature. For that reason, I find most areas of cognitive science, especially the [psychology of happiness](https://www.happinesslab.fm/) a very fruitful field to read more into. In fact, this was the field that caused me to restructure all these areas in the first place.

Finally, I try and make time for everything else here that helps me flesh out a reasonable philosophy for life and maintain a healthy mind. This includes learning about specific philosophies (e.g. stoicism, Daoism), exploring psychoactive substances, writing and journaling, my general education as well focusing on the remaining outer rings to provide a buffer for my mind (it exists afterall within the real world).

## Body
This area includes everything to do with looking after the soma, the vessel that transports the mind. The most important thing without a doubt to focus on when it comes to your physical health is to get your [sleep in order](https://themattwalkerpodcast.buzzsprout.com/). After that, nutrition and [movement](https://youtu.be/snAhsXyO3Ck?t=95) are the next levers to pull on.

I also like to remain ambitious and have fun when it comes to how I use my body. I love to move: to dance, to do handstands and swing on monkey bars. I learn new physical skills wherever possible, purely for the fun of it and to remind myself what it's like to play. 

## Home
A new area for me and one I struggle with: designing my own environment in such a way that it gives me strength and energy. I used to just see my apartment as the place I slept in, but the pandemic showed me just how important it to have a real home. 

Having a secure location you can always return to is critical for good mental and physical health. That space should offer you the rest and recovery you need to handle the day-to-day stresses we can't avoid. It should be divided into spaces suited to the main things you do at home: sleeping, eating, exercising and these days, working. It doesn't need to be big, and you may have to get creative to find all those places, but having them is important to help your mind switch contexts and rest properly. 

I also like to build [rituals](https://hbr.org/2013/12/new-research-rituals-make-us-value-things-more): things you do to show your home and belongings respect. You begin to actually treat your surroundings with a degree of spirituality and reverence, and cleaning becomes something fun. You begin to enjoy decorating and doing things purely for the aesthetic. It becomes clearer when you should turn off your electronic devices and start getting ready for bed. Still all things I don't do perfectly, but it's getting better. 

I also like to include cooking in this category. I've spent a fair amount of effort learning how to cook the last couple of years for all the obvious reasons cooking your own meals is good: saving money, improving nutrition and making tastier meals. It's also a good reason to have people over and imbue your home with good memories, strengthening the effects above.
