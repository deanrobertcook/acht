A friend of mine gave me the book, *Eveything is Fucked* by Mark Manson for Christmas, and it's been a gripping read. It's the first book in a while I haven't been able to put down. 

Perhaps the thing most enthralling about the book is the timeliness of its message. It actually first came out in 2019, shortly before this period of significant change that has been thrust upon our lives. The warnings against narcissim and dogmatism are perhaps more important than ever in a world that is scared and unsure of its own future. 

The book is divided into two parts. So far I'm still making my way through the second part, which seems to mainly offer a way out of the wreckage the first part left in its wake having passed through my mind, but I think its already worth writing about the effect the book has had on me the last week since finishing Manson's thesis on hope. 

The wisdom of the book I think can be summed up in three words: *Give up hope*. 

Why should you ultimately give up hope? How would that help anyone? Well, because - as the title suggests - everything *is* fucked. It always has been, and it always will be. Psychologically speaking, we're all doomed to hedonic adaptation and the impact bias makes it very difficult for us to even predict just how happy achieving our goals will make us. Everything we can ever hope to achieve, once accomplished, only leaves us empty and looking for more, no matter how much material wealth we accrue for ourselves[2].

Not only is hope dangerous for us as individuals, but, Manson argues, hope is the driving force behind all the bullshit we do as human beings, leading us to form theological and ideological religions that promise to fulfill our hopes and in doing so bring us to committing attrocities. When we hope too strongly for a given future, we're susceptible to the next iconic movement that promises to bring us to that future, whatever the means.

I've heard this message in many forms before, particularly in contemplative contexts, usually packaged as "hope is fear in disguise"[3] or "desire leads to suffering". Perhaps it was Manson's humourous and aggressive writing style, but either way, when I finished reading his thesis on hope, it felt as if a weight dropped from my shoulders. 

You see, I'm going through a somewhat stressful period in my life. I'm struggling with finding a satisfying job and, not wanting to put myself through hours of programming for a product or company I just really don't connect with, I've quit several projects this year, the last one a month ago[4].

Before I started reading the book, I was beginning to feel quite stressed. What if I don't find another job soon with a bit more stability? If I get another job I'm unhappy in, that's another short stop on my resume I have to explain, another period of instability to put myself through. 

I started to become angry with my situation, looking for external forces to blame. Perhaps it's the global consumer tech industry and all the bullshit it's cramming down our throats, creating a thousand jobs for advertising companies and snap-chat filters for every one job saving the planet. Perhaps it's our failing social systems that are making us more isolated and lonely, rising costs of living and a pandemic that's brought the world to a standstill.

Simultaneously I started becoming very insecure: have I lost the ability to work well with others after over two years working remotely as a freelancer? Am I just a bad programmer? Am I just too out of touch with the real world and don't know how to look for jobs anymore?  

Maybe it's all those things, or maybe I'm wrong about every single one of them. It actually doesn't matter. What Manson did was to help me realise one thing: there will always be problems. I will always feel panicked and stressed if I feel panicked and stressed now. Everything is, and will always be, fucked, so just do the things you have to do, do the things you *ought* to do, and do them happily, because there'll be no perfect, unfucked moment after you finally solve all of your problems at which you'll finally reach eternal bliss. 

As with anything, I'm sure that *completely* giving up hope is probably a bad idea. It's probably true that we want some hope in our lives, or else what's the point of doing anything? It's there for a reason, but like our propensitiy to seek out sugary foods is doing us no good in the modern context, perhaps we live in a time of too much hope. I for one, am going to go on a hope diet for a while and will try to just enjoy things more. Thanks Mark!

And just in time to enjoy Christmas, too.

Cheers.
