Economic incentives are perhaps the most powerful leverages we have to encourage behaviour change in our societies - make train and bus rides cheaper than going by car, and unsurprisingly, more people give up their cars; force fathers to give up their paternity leave if they don't use it and [more men take on the role of caretaker](https://www.iceland.is/press/press--media-kit/gender-equality-in-iceland/) in the home.

It's tempting to end the debate there: "just fix the incentives. Boom. Mission accomplished". But which incentive structures do we pick for ourselves? Well, perhaps that can be answered with a few [well-conducted studies](https://www.gallup.com/home.aspx)? Just find out which structures offer the most utilitarian benefit and implement those, right? If it's obvious that more equal representation of women throughout our society brings us closer to say, [reaching our climate goals](https://bloombergcities.medium.com/5-women-mayors-to-watch-for-climate-leadership-3d3ea407afed), then that's a force for good we want to replicate elsewhere with similar incentive structures around the world.

Now, for the record, I do in fact think that's a fantastic strategy: follow those plans with the best evidence we have. But, in my opinion, it's only half the battle. I'm going to call it the top-down approach: look around the world for systems that provably work and design a incentive structures that [nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_%28book%29) us in the right direction. People with authority and knowledge are designing systems that reach down into and shape our lives. 

If this were a calculus problem, I see it as the part where we [find the integral](https://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers). But what are we putting back together here as we attempt to integrate the lifestyles of millions of people into one cohesive whole?

The answer here are our values. The intuitions that we build up over the course of our lives that tell us whether something is going well or going poorly; our gut feelings of what is right and wrong. To continue stretching this abstract analogy, our value systems allow us to measure the slope of our current trajectory through life, in this moment in time and space - within our individual contexts. They are the derivative. 

Before any large-scale incentive (re)design can take place, it takes individuals with nothing but a hunch to recognise that our trajectory isn't right. There will have been, at this point in time, no research conducted that tells these people *why* things aren't right. They will not be able to rationalise and justify the intuition yet. They will just *know* things aren't right.

Our values allow us to make these judgements. They are the axioms we hold for ourselves and have gathered - implicitly or explicitly - over the course of our lives that have allowed us to survive this far. As a society, we would do well to really listen to not only our own value judgements, but those of our fellow citizens. 

While I'm an optimist and believe that most people are mostly good most of the time, not all values are good. Some are empty, some destructive, some hateful. Some allow us to be easily exploited or cause us to be overly cautious in exploring the world. For this reason, it's important for us to reflect on and examine our values as closely as possible. 

One way I like to do this is to simply list them out and explore their limits. So, without further ado, here are the values I have steadily come to see as the positive ones guiding my life. I don't claim to live up them perfeclty all the time - perhaps I'll do another article exploring my more sinister, implicit values when I'm feeling braver - but for now, it's a start:

## Do not be apathetic, do not be aggressive.
- Aggression is displayed when an individual advances their own goals at the expense of another - through lying, fraud, manipulation or physical violence. The spectrum of violence starts with seeing others as opponents. 
- Apathy leads to laziness, willful ignorance and the inability to resist evil. 
- Both are highly corrosive to a complex, cooperative society.

## Apply your own oxygen mask first.
- A.k.a. act first locally, then regional, national, global
- You understand your home better than you understand someone elses. You know where things are and how they work. You can use that understanding to effect more change.
- The universe is fractal. The closer you look at something, the more sub-dimensions you find the thing contains. 
- Come more into contact with your community, understand its problems, understand its people. Solve their problems first.
- Like the cells of our bodies, we want our local communities to maintain independent functioning, while still participating in ever larger contextual rings of interdependence. 
- Share ideas and raw resources globally, produce goods and services locally. 

## Be authentic and transparent
- Honesty is a blunt tool. It often fails to consider timing and can easily become aggressive. Sprich, sometimes no one cares about your opinion.
- Instead, listen to and sharpen your "gut" instinct, the system 1 thinking, das Bauchgef√ºhl. This is authenticity. Train it in your interactions with others, within your profession, understand what it has to say about your health and wellbeing. 
- You can only train it by letting it make mistakes. Do as you feel is right, and stand up to any consequences when things go wrong.
- Understand it's limits, and communicate to others what is happening whenever they express the need to understand what you're doing. 
- Trust that you are a good human being, like most others, and that if you do what you really want, you'll also achieve a lot of good for the world. 

## See technology as a tool, not God
- Modern technology promises more and more power and even immortality. It has replaced for many of us, the role that [religion once played](https://stevesammartino.com/2021/11/05/technology-as-a-religion/) in the past.
- Tech should be used to achieve things in the real world. Get offline as fast as possible.
- We should take a lesson from the Amish and deeply consider the consequences of each new piece of tech we introduce.
- Like any tool, we should understand deeply how our tech works, and make sure that we can always make do without it. 

## Aim for accuracy, not efficiency
- Think of an archer shooting an array at a moving target. 
- Accuracy demands efficiency, as drawing another arrow wastes more time than preparing the shot, or perhaps picking another target altogether. 
- Accuracy demands practice. A good archer would train relentlessly 
- Accuracy demands self-knowledge. You must know where you stand and what the surrounding conditions are like.
- Accuracy demands minimalism. To gain a vantage over the target, the archer must be nimble.
- Accuracy has an end-state - once the target is hit, the archer can retreat, regroup and find another target.
- Rather than an efficient economy, we want an accurate economy, where our goals are based on human-centric design. We figure out what we *need*, aim for that, achieve it and then pause to reconsider our next goal. Rather than just working more efficiently for growth's sake - put the purpose of our work in the spotlight.
