Economic incentives are perhaps the most powerful leverages we have to encourage behaviour change in our societies - make train and bus rides cheaper than going by car, and unsurprisingly, more people give up their cars; force fathers to give up their paternity leave if they don't use it and [more men take on the role of caretaker](https://www.iceland.is/press/press--media-kit/gender-equality-in-iceland/) in the home.

But as I see it, this only accounts for half the battle in designing ourselves better lives. In order for us to decide what incentive structures to pick and to give the incentive structures fertile ground on which to take hold and have any chance of succeeding, the individuals within those structures have to align sufficiently on what they value. 

While our knowledge on designing a better world seems to be growing, it's frustrating that our progress is often hampered by individuals with [empty values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying). As society - thankfully - continues to become more aware of the damage it's doing to the world and to itself, it's becoming more important than ever to question the values of the people we give our money, time and attention to.

So, without further ado, here are the values I have steadily come to see as the positive ones guiding my life. I don't claim to live up them perfeclty all the time, but for now, it's a start.

## 1. Do not be apathetic, do not be aggressive.
I define aggression as anything in which I perform some act so as to further my goals at the expense of somebody else's. I like this definition because it then includes lying, fraud, manipulation and omitting of facts as well as physical aggression (credits to Sam Harris for the original idea).

Aggression and apathy are for me the two states of mind to be most careful of. They have surely evolved for good reason, but I see no way in which they are any longer constructive for modern society, except as a warning sign things are not going well (and in the case of aggression - in situations of life-and-death). 

But aside from that, both are corrosive to a complex, cooperative society. They cause division, create evil and also sap our ability to resist evil: either I will be happy to see evil happen to those that anger me (aggression) or I don't care enough about anyone else to bother stopping the evil (apathy). 

We need to care for ourselves. We need to reach out across our aisles of division and take care for one another. We need to care about living harmoniously with the environment. In order to achieve our goals, we need to put down our weapons of anger, carry our own weight and give support to those that are strugging.
## 2. Apply your own oxygen mask first.
I've done a full 180 on this one throughout the course of my life. I no longer believe that the most effective strategy is to simply find the global poor and help them first.

Instead, I think we need to focus on getting our own houses in order. Getting ourselves stable as individuals first (within the constrains of value 1.), then we need to act locally and regionally to stamp out injustice and ensure those around us can contribute to a better world. Then, once our towns and cities are in order, start thinking at national and global levels how we can send aid out far and wide. 

There are of course exceptions here, as with any rules. We should care about the people working on our supply chains and make sure they are treated fairly, as one example. 

But even in those cases, the same thinking applies: we can communicate far better with those we are physically close to or come into contact with regularly; we can understand the intricicies of our local issues far better than those of foriegn cultures. We only have a chance of shaping the values of those people we are close to, and should start there first.

Just as independence as individuals only comes from owning your own problems, our towns and cities must do the same. We can't solve other people's problems for them, we can only act as examples, good or bad.

## 3. Be authentic and transparent
Within the constrains of the values above, I think it's then important to begin sharpening your gut instinct, the system's 1 thinking: das Bauchgef√ºhl. 

Unfortunately this only comes from training it: in your career and in your interactions with others. But essentially, the formula is pretty simple: do what you *feel* is right and stand up to any consequences when things go wrong. This is the part of one's life where making mistakes is incredibly important.

However, do also aim to understand the limits of your intuition. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that everything you think is [the ultimate truth](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-false-consensus-effect-2795030). This system is far more intelligent than we often give it credit for, but as we're learning (and we always are), it's important to *communicate* openly with others just how you're feeling and why you think so. When you do, you often learn a great deal more about yourself than if you say or do whatever you *think* you should. It's this transparency that allows you to train your authenticity. 

Trust that you are a good human being, like most other people, and that if you train your intuition well, you'll also eventually achieve a lot of good for the world. 

## 4. Aim for accuracy, not efficiency
Efficiency is the aim of the game in the modern world. But as the complexity of our world continues to rise, something gets lost with this efficiency-seeking. It's easy to fall into the trap of celebrating gains in efficiency along some metric while entirely forgetting why we picked that metric in the first place. 

Instead, I think trying to improve the accuracy of our efforts is a far better mindset to have than just the efficiency. Accuracy often demands efficiency (at least for challenging tasks), but does much more than that. Accuracy forces us to keep the goal in mind, demands self-knowledge and understanding, encourages minimalism and has an end-state - namely, that of the goal being reached.

As an example, let's consider personal income. An efficiency mindset would come to the conclusion that "more is more". More money means more time and more freedom, so more money is better. If I have a chance of getting a raise or a better paid job, I should go for it.

An accuracy mindset, as I'm trying to describe here, would instead force oneself to look one's own goals. "I want to be rich" is far too broad a definition. Okay, so how much money do you need? But then you have to answer the question: "what for?" In my case, I want to be able to maintain my modest flat in Berlin, afford a coffee each morning and have plenty of time to do the things I enjoy doing or making the world a better place. For that, a 50-60K income is more than enough. Anything above that and I'm actually being *wasteful* in my efforts.

In fact, if I cut out all of the things that are really not that important or enriching to me, I might need even less
than that to achieve my goal. If I manage to find work that's meaningful to me, then suddenly I've also gained an extra 8 hours a day doing something I enjoy!

This idea is by no means new, but I like framing it this way. It reminds me to chase for simplicity. It reminds me to ask myself what I really *need*. It's minimalistic at heart, and I think we'd be better off if our economy functioned in a similar way: aiming for a comfortable stasis; a clear and achievable goal, rather than just simply trying to always find more.

## 5. See technology as a tool, not God
Modern technology promises more and more power and even immortality. It has replaced for many of us, the role that [religion once played](https://stevesammartino.com/2021/11/05/technology-as-a-religion/) in the past.

However, this trend seems more and more dangerous to me. While I'm still a big believer that technology will help us 

- Tech should be used to achieve things in the real world. Get offline as fast as possible.
- We should take a lesson from the Amish and deeply consider the consequences of each new piece of tech we introduce.
- Like any tool, we should understand deeply how our tech works, and make sure that we can always make do without it.
