If you're reading this, then perhaps you're a potential new employer, welcome! My job on this page is to convince you why you'd want to hire me üòâ

I'm currently looking to join an amazing team or company as a frontend or fullstack developer, ideally with the potential to learn more design - whether that be UI/UX or product.

I have now close to seven years of software programming experience in a professional setting. Having started my career in Android development, and now having worked several years in backend development, I've recently decided it's time to change again. You can find a more detailed history of my career on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanrobertcook/). What I want to do here is to tell the story behind the change. 

But first, how about a quick game of naughts and crosses (or tic-tac-toe, for the Americans out there)?

This is nothing special, just the [React introduction example](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) with my own twist to it. The example is simple, but should hopefully give a quick TL;DR on my skills. Pease check out the [underlying code](https://github.com/deanrobertcook/acht/tree/main/src/js) and have a look around!

By the way, you can't win... I used a minimax algorithm which in naughts and crosses always at least guarantees a draw...

And this is just some fun I've been having trying to refresh my Uni knowledge of 3D animation using **three.js**. Here's the code

Anyway, onto the story!

## Background
I've been working for the last year as a freelancer and remotely since before the pandemic. In that time I've had quite a few different projects, some successful and others not. Working alone most of the time has taught me a lot about myself and first hand the difficulties of having a remote setup. In all honesty, I'm sick of it. 

All this experimenting has given me a clear idea of how I now want to work. I miss working with a local team, even if only a couple of days a week at an office or co-working space. The opportunities to mentor and be mentored simply don't exist to the same extent in a completely remote setting.

I've also spent a lot of time in the pandemic thinking about the role of technology in our lives. Too often we blindly accept new technology without thinking about the consequences and year by year our digital world is growing abstracter and more complex as a result; something which is leading to many of the psychological issues we are seeing around the world (fake news, political division, outrage and depression, to name a few). Now I want to figure out how to wind back some of this digital consumerism and use my skills as a programmer to help lead the way to a smarter, more attentive society. The key to achieving this is, in my opinion, through simple, human-centric design: building software (and hardware) that we actually *need*, that helps us connect and achieve things in the real world, not just more distraction.

## This blog
To that end, for the last month or so I've taken time off to teach myself the basics of building websites from scratch. Why websites? Well, websites are where we go to to find information about the real world - where to buy the things we need or when and where an event might take place. Through the right design, there's a huge opportunity in website construction to build an Internet that encourages people to get offline faster. 

The first thing to do then was to build myself a blog, something I've wanted to do [for a while now](finding-my-vocation.html). Not only would it give me the chance to build a website, but it's a platform on which I can explore my opinions and express them authentically. Turns out that writing is hard, but it's definitely having [a huge benefit](why-write.html).

Building the blog from scratch also had the desired effect of teaching me all of the necessary skills to be a successful frontend or fullstack developer. You can find a more detailed explanation of the blog's technical side on the [main Github README](https://github.com/deanrobertcook/acht), but here is a short list of some of the things I had to learn about along the way:
- [Alternative Cloud](https://www.linode.com/category/alternative-cloud/) (Linode) providers,
- Alpine Linux (package manager, musl vs glibc),
- Linux server hardening (e.g. user management and sshd config),
- nginx server configuration,
- Pug templates,
- using webpack to automate my build (in effect creating my own SSG),
- how to write a [webpack loader](https://github.com/deanrobertcook/acht/tree/main/build),
- more Node.js internals (e.g. the difference between ES6 and Node modules),
- tailwindcss and [utility classes](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/),
- a bunch of CSS fundamentals (thank you [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)!),
- the basics of responsive design (try it out!) and media queries,
- some typography, color theory and layout basics,
- the importance of HTML semantics,
- more React and JavaScript,
- testing with Jest,

just to name a few!

## What next?

I've barely scratched the surface here on what there is to learn in the frontend world, but I've had a lot of fun so far, meandering at each step along the way and taking my time to understand things deeply so that I can achieve the simplicity I'm aiming for. I hope to now continue building websites and software for friends and local businesses to help them achieve their real-world goals.

However, the path to making the world a better place won't be via building websites alone, and until I can make it a viable career for myself I'll need to work somwhere to earn a living, where I can continue to sharpen my skills and contribute to other people's ideas of what will improve people's lives. This is why I'm now on the hunt to join a company that also shares my values and is also using technology to actually make the world a more conscious place. 

Combined with my previous experience and now extensive background in software development, I feel confident I can quickly pickup the role as either a frontend or fullstack developer. If you appreciate my professional values and want to be the company that benefits from my loyalty and hard work and can offer me the room to grow that I require, please don't hesitate to ask me more and try out my knowledge in other areas, or read around elsewhere in the blog to get a better sense of what my personal values and interests are. I look forward to hearing more from you and potentially joining your outstanding team!

Cheers, <br>
Dean.

**PS:** F√ºr die deutschsprachige Unternehmen da drau√üen, ich schreibe hier was kurzes zu meinen Deutschf√§higkeiten. Ich lerne Deutsch jetzt seit √ºber 10 Jahren und bin auf jeden Fall der Aufgabe gewachsen, als Programmier in der Sprache zu arbeiten. Trotzdem habe habe ich bis jetzt nur auf Englisch gearbeitet (eine Tatsache, die mich oft ein bisschen entt√§uscht). Es wird eine gewisse Anpassungsphase brauchen, bevor ich mich in der Rolle richtig wohl f√ºhle, aber ich w√ºrde die Herausforderung jetzt gerne angehen!
