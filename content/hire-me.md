If you're reading this, then perhaps you're a potential new employer, welcome! My job on this page is to convince you why you'd want to hire me ðŸ˜‰

I'm currently looking to join an amazing team or company as a frontend or fullstack developer, ideally with the potential to learn more design - whether that be UI/UX or product.

### Overview
I have over seven years of software programming experience in a professional setting. I started off as an Android developer moved to Backend development a few years ago. However, I miss working with tangible end products, UIs and dealing with real users, so time for another shift!

I've also been working as a freelancer the last couple of years, which in all honesty, has been a mistake. I miss working in teams, having an office to go to and solving problems with other people. The freelancer life is just too lonely for me. 

I place a high importance on good design and engineering, always aiming to simplify any systems and workflows I come into contact with. I have experience with leading a small team and all of the associated skills: hiring, feature planning and coordinating with other teams. 

You can find more about my resume on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanrobertcook/). What I want to do here is showcase some of my relevant skills.

## Frontend and React
I've used HTML, CSS and JS throughout my career for small support and hobby projects, but never really had to build a polished feature. This website is my effort to fix that.
