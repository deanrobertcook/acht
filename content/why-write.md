Why start another blog? Why try and contribute to the millions or (by now, even billions) of other voices typing away on the Internet? 

## For a stable middle class
Why do anything for that matter? It doesn't matter whether you're making computer programs or a professional high jumper, there will always be someone better than you on the world's stage. Wouldn't we just be better off letting the world's best do all the work and the rest of us just relax if we don't have any hope of getting to the top?

This is often the thinking I'd fall into in my personal life. We [praise the elite](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/205-failure-meritocracy) in our modern society for their ability to change the world - and for good reason, some of their feats are damned impressive. But where does that put me, the regular Joe or Jane? If I can't create a world-class blog with millions of readers like some of the greats out there, then what's the point? It's also unlikely I'm going to find a niche for myself either. It's an unwritten law of the Internet that *somebody else has already thought of it* - whatever "it" is - and they're probably doing it better.

It's easy within our meritocratic society to fall victim to this comparative thinking. After all, it's hard to escape the feats of the elite on all of our various news and social media platforms as their content floats to the tops of the various content-recommendation algorithms. In an overconnected network, the loudest nodes will always overpower the system. However, we need to be careful about continually silencing the greater middle class of creators in favour of a small elite - whether in [reality or online](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class?stream=future). 

For a stable ecosystems that don't become the playground for just a few lucky individuals, it is necessary (but not sufficient - an article for another day) for the masses to feel empowered to create and not just to passively consume. We need the same ideas to be processed again and again from slightly different angles; we need local views on how global trends might be affecting each of our unique neighbourhoods. Without the diversity of opinion that a large middle creator class brings, we risk sliding from a technocracy into a... techtatorship. 

## To sharpen my thinking
There was a quote about this somewhere: 

> "I write to know what I think" 

...or something along those lines. Perhaps someone can enlighten me as to the source. At any rate, I think a lot. I consume a lot of interesting content that gets me thinking about the world's problems. And yet, I'm noticing a gentle slip into intellectual voyeurism, consuming episode after episode of my favourite thought-provoking podcasts without doing anything with that knowledge.

Writing forces you to actively recall the quotes and content that triggered a given thought or idea, or go searching for them again to add as links to back up your argument. Then you must go on to explain your individual thought as if for another human being, in effect gaining all the benefits of teaching something to someone. You must stop and think about each sentence, it's validity, and whether it fits together with the essay as a whole. 

Your personal essays become an integrated body of self-knowledge, unique in the fact that no one else has had quite the same set of experiences or read quite the same set of books. You show others how you arrived at the arguments you did or perhaps unwittingly expose blindspots in your thinking that others might then hopefully shine a light on for you. Over time, your thinking will become clearer and and your arguments sharper. You are ultimately putting all of that collected knowledge to good use. 

## To practice transparency
Finally, writing for me forces me to confront my perfectionism. The fastest way for me to get an article out is to a) write a little bit each day, and b) to just publish *whatever* I write in that time. I often come back and tidy things up later, which is the reason many of my essays are in dot-point form. I also allow myself full freedom to come back and completely rewrite large chunks of articles that I no longer agree with to facilitate this process (I do want to put up the edit histories for all my articles at some point though!).

By practicing the principal of [iteration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration) in something as simple as writing, I'm reminding myself the importance of publishing incremental chunks of work, and how effective that can be for making meaningful progress on a given path. A published essay in dot-point form is infinitely better than a fully polished one that no one ever can possibly see.

Ultimately, writing is a uniquely human and critical activity for all of us to be getting better in. By writing a little bit every day, I can challenge and consolidate what I know and in the process hopefully inspire one or two other lonely souls out there to take on the challenge of maintaining an egalitarian Internt with me.
