Why start another blog? Why try and contribute to the millions or (by now, even billions) of other voices typing away on the Internet? I'm not that good a writer if you compare me to any of the big guns out there. Having mainly studied computer science, writing essays was never really something asked much of me. I'm not really qualified to have an opinion on anything, except for programming and computer software (boring). So why do it? 

I generally slide quite easily into this sort of comparitive thinking and all it achieves is to hold me back from doing the things *I* want to do. Ultimately though, the reasons have to be personal. It's simply too unlikely that with my writing I'm going to change the world for that to be the reason. 

So, here are some of my personal reasons to get into the habit of writing, as if for an audience.

## To tell myself a story
Imagining that there might be even one person who'll one day read these words has a profoundly different effect on my mind than when I just write for myself. As a beginner, it's quite frightening. It's still unclear to me what I should and shouldn't make public. Some things feel too personal, some too unoriginal. 

However, what I'm noticing in the last few weeks of clobbering together a few thoughts is that, even with the most boring idea, I have to tell a story. I have to lay the groundwork, explain the context and initial conditions, then begin crafting an experience for my potential readers, step by step in a way that would be logical for any reader, arbitrarily deep into the future<sup>1</sup>. 

This process of story telling is fun and deeply therapeutic. It's a messy and chaotic process, much more like working with clay than I could have expected. I'm constantly jumping around, throwing new things in and tearing other things apart. But, when I finally settle on something I'm happy with, it feels as though something clicks into place; like a little pocket of my mind can rest easily knowing it's literally got its story straight. 

In retrospect it's hardly surprising, but of all the ideas I start with, maybe a tenth of them will actually feel worthy of more attention once I let them sit for a month, week, or sometimes even only a few hours. Some ideas that seem so important when floating around in my mind as abstract images just fail to connect with real language, no matter how many angles I approach them from: a sign that perhaps they don't have much merit, or that they'll need a lot more work to bring them into reality.

And so, writing as if for an audience helps me form the stories that I tell *myself.* It helps me sort through what's important and unimportant to me, and gives me at least the sense that I'm making my own life better. 
## To sharpen my mind
I consume a lot of interesting content that gets me thinking about the world's problems. And yet, after my podcast addiction kicked off a couple of years ago, I started to notice a gentle slip into intellectual voyeurism, consuming episode after episode of my favourite thought-provoking podcasts without doing anything with that knowledge before most of it would slip into the abyss.

Writing for a potential audience forces you to be much more rigorous in referencing the quotes and content that triggered a given thought or idea, often meaning a frustrating search for the long-forgotten article, book or podcast to link to. This searching means reviewing the content you might have only listened to once, at a time when it's actually relevant to you.

Then you must go on to explain how those references back up your idea, as if teaching another human being something important about the reference, in effect gaining all the benefits to learning that teaching someone else confer. You must stop and think about each statement, it's validity, and whether it fits together with the essay as a whole. 

Eventually, your personal essays become an integrated body of self-knowledge, unique in the fact that no one else has had quite the same set of experiences or read quite the same set of books. You show others how you arrived at the arguments you did or perhaps unwittingly expose blindspots in your thinking that others might then hopefully shine a light on for you. Over time, your thinking will become clearer and and your arguments sharper. You are ultimately putting all of that collected knowledge to good use. 

## To practice putting something out there
Finally, writing for me forces me to confront my perfectionism. The fastest way for me to get an article out is to a) write a little bit each day, and b) to just publish *whatever* I write in that time<sup>2</sup>. I often come back and tidy things up later, which is the reason many of my essays may be in dot-point form. I also allow myself full freedom to come back and completely rewrite large chunks of articles that I no longer agree with to facilitate this process (I do want to put up the edit histories for all my articles at some point though!).

By practicing this iterative process in something as simple as writing, I'm reminding myself the importance of publishing incremental chunks of work, and how effective that can be for making meaningful progress on a given path. A published essay in dot-point form is infinitely better than a fully polished one that no one ever can possibly see.

Ultimately, writing is a uniquely human activity and critical for all of us to be getting better in. By writing a little bit every day, I can challenge and consolidate what I know and in the process hopefully inspire one or two other lonely souls out there to take on the challenge of maintaining an egalitarian Internet with me.
