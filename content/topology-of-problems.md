- What shapes can a trend have? Linear, exponential, logarithmic? What about any other shape you can possibly imagine?
- The [Anscombe's quartet and the Datasaurus dozen](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs)
- Couple that with multiple dimensions of interest (we often talk in just 2), and things start to get really confusing. 
- Throw in there any issues at the point of data collection - consistency, human bias, etc., you need a lot of expertise to sort out the mess. 
- Start talking about statistics on a global scale collected by a range of institutions, and things are impossible.

## The world is getting better...?
- There are many people that argue the world is getting better ([Gapminder][https://upgrader.gapminder.org/]). These averages are probably true, things are getting better for more people.
- Some things are getting worse in different pockets of society: e.g., suicide rates are down globally, but increasing for certain age groups.
- One person argues that [depression is on the rise](https://thelostconnections.com/), [others](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2018/jan/08/is-everything-johann-hari-knows-about-depression-wrong-lost-connections) point out flaws in his arguments.

## Statistics is hard
- I'm no expert on the field, I've only done introductory, university-level courses on the matter. But that still puts me a fair bit ahead of the average (maybe?). 
- Even for someone with a decent background in mathematics and computer science, understanding global trends is impossible. 
- The role of [focused research groups](https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx) 

## The problem is shape:
- No matter how well we think we understand a trend, an unexpected pothole that we overlook in the zoomed-out, flat curve can often derail us.
- Think of a balloon expanding - when it pops, it pops first locally while the average shape of the balloon stays intact. It doesn't take long, however, for the whole thing to collapse.

## Keeping ourselves focused
- Global trends are confusing
- We understand the pulse of our own cities better
- For the average person, trying to understand global trends is only distracting
- Experts and focused groups should (carefully) focus on global trends and relationships

## We know what we need to do:
- I think most people feel what the right thing is, we often don't need statistics to tell us what that is
- Sleep better, work less, eat healthier (and less meat), move more, spend more time with friends, buy local, use public transport, travel by plane less. 
- At the city level - improve energy-use efficiency, use more busses and public transport, reduce car use, make public spaces pedestrian and human-friendly, set up incentives to encourage healthier lifestyles. 
- That's a tall order, but if we focused solely on living more harmoniously with ourselves and our local environments, we can at least ensure that we're okay and not doing harm to others. 
- Then we can leave it up to the experts as to how to help others far away.
