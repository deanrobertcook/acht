Why start another blog? Why try and contribute to the millions or (by now, even billions) of other voices typing away on the Internet?

### My old, global view
- Your opinion is unlikely to make a difference or even be read by others
- There are many more out there who are better than you. 
- Better to just find another niche and not bother with writing?

### Writing as processing
- I consume a lot of content and have a lot of ideas
- The best way to learn is to teach. Writing is almost like teaching in that you have the opportunity to question your understanding of every thought you produce. 

### Writing to provide a different perspective
- No one else on the planet has listened to or read exactly the same set of podcasts, articles or books. Maybe I have made connections no one else has.

### Writing to find out what I think
- There was a quote about this somewhere.
- Writing helps me categorise and 

### Writing to sharpen my arguments
- Another benefit of questioning every line you produce, is that you must (or at least, should!) then verify any statements, or at least acknowledge the limits of your knowledge. 

### To practice transparency
- By posting the content one writes, one must prepare the writing for potential consumption. This only strengthens the other effects and if I'm lucky, it will invite criticism which in turn strengthens arguments and thinking further.
- Practice the principal of [iteration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration): publish the smallest possible thing as soon as possible. For example, an essay in dot point form is better than a polished essay that's never finished.

### Other forms of creation
- All of the arguments here, even the depressing starting point, apply to other forms of creativity.
