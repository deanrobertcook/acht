Welcome to the inner workings of my blog.

Here's a brief summary of the tech stack:

### Hosting:
Runs on a tiny node on [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) (a pretty cool Alternative cloud provider). 

### Backend: 
Nginx on an Alpine Linux container. I can definitely get behind the philosophy of both technologies, particularly that they are small and focus on doing one thing well. 
### Frontend:
Self-rolled SSG, super minimal. About [100 lines of Node.js code](https://github.com/deanrobertcook/acht/blob/main/compile.js) putting together a few pug templates injected with my essays.

### Design:
I've focused on keeping things as simple as possible, and have done my best to keep things responsive as I update the design. 

The CSS code also follows the [utility-first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) approach to styling markup. Even for a small project like this, it has a lot of benefits, particularly in its potential as a way of making learning CSS easier.

I'm still learning a great deal, especially when it comes to accessability and design, but so far it's a been a fun start ðŸ˜Š
